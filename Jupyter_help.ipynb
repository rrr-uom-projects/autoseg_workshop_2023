    "# Jupyter Help\n",
    "Jupyter is a tool for running python in a notebook form. A notebook is simply a document containing code and accompanying text describing/explaning the code. You're reading one right now!\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks are divided into cells which, for the most part, come in two flavours - Markdown and code. A markdown cell is where you can type words to explain the code. Try double clicking on this text, and you should be shown the markdown that created it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Code cells contain python code. There are a couple of things to bear in mind about notebooks that differ from normal python scripts:\n",
    "- Notebook cells can be run in any order\n",
    "- The output of any cell is available in any other cell (as if it were all global scope in python)\n",
    "- Typos can really screw you over. If you make a typo in a variable name, that variable still exists, and anywhere where you made the same typo will use the old variable instead of the new one. This has personally led to at least three hours debugging that could have been saved by being able to spell.\n",
    "- Default plotting behaviour is to just give you a picture with no interactivity. We can override it though\n",
    "\n",
    "All cells are executed by either clicking the play button at the top left corner of the cell, or by clicking in it and pressing ctrl+enter. You can also press shift+enter, which will run the curent cell and move to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter escapes and magic\n",
    "You will see a few cells with lines starting in either an exclamation mark (!) or a percentage sign (%). These lines are called escapes and magics. An escape simply makes jupyter run the command after it in a bash shell (or cmd if you're on windows), this allows us to do stuff like run wget to download data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Magics do things to alter the state of jupyter, for example by turning matplotlib interactivity on, or enabling the browser-in-browser that allows us to use tensorboard monitoring. The most important thing to note about magics is that they can't have a comment after them. You can look up some jupyter magics [here](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you know how to drive this notebook, let's start running some stuff!"
